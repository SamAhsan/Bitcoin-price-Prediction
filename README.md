I used the latest two months' Bitcoin price statistics, which I downloaded from https://www.investing.com/. 
I created a machine learning algorithm that trains itself on a BitcoinData1.csv file and then predicts future high and low prices. But for this you have to add Latest Price and Open Price of the day as Input.
I also incorporated MSE and R2 score measurement code to assess the performance of the ML model.
